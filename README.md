# Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between TV advertisement budgets and sales.

## Features
- Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Model training and evaluation with `scikit-learn`.
- Calculation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers along with the corresponding sales figures.
**Kaggle Dataset Link**: [Advertising Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/advertising-sales-dataset/data)

### Columns
- `TV Ad Budget ($)`
- `Radio Ad Budget ($)`
- `Newspaper Ad Budget ($)`
- `Sales ($)`

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Analysis**: Scatter plot of TV Ad Budgets vs. Sales.
2. **Model Training**: Built a linear regression model to predict sales based on TV Ad Budgets.
3. **Evaluation**: Calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
4. **Visualization**: Plotted the regression line over the actual data.

## Results
- **Coefficient**: `VALUE_HERE`
- **Intercept**: `VALUE_HERE`
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `VALUE_HERE`
- **R² Score**: `VALUE_HERE`

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SerifeGokdas1/LineerRegression.git
   cd LineerRegression
